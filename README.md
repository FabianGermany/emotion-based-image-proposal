# Emotion-Based Image-Proposal
University project @Hanyang University

## About
This project is about a smart image proposal for the co-driver display in a car. 
If an emotion recognition systems recognizes emotions like anger, sadness etc.
(i. e. a negative valence of a driver or a
too high or too low arousal), the co-driver display will show images trying
to create a positive valence and a suitable arousal of the driver
in order to avoid stress, distractions and finally car accidents.
